# codes-c-plusplus
These codes were used at https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/en/login during my college. 

Most have not been revised (such as indentation and best practices) and were done in the first semesters of college (I only enter the codes when I remember, but I no longer use the portal for lack of time), but all codes have been accepted by the judge of this portal and this repository was, really, used as a repository. :laughing: :bat:
